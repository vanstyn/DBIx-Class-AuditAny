# ABSTRACT: Default 'ChangeSet' context object class for DBIx::Class::AuditAny

=head1 NAME

DBIx::Class::AuditAny::AuditContext::ChangeSet - Default 'ChangeSet' context object 
class for DBIx::Class::AuditAny

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This object class represents a "set" of changes grouped together, typically all applied within
the scope of a single transaction. The changes can span across multiple individual changes, 
which can also represent changes to multiple different columns.

This class is used internally and should not be used directly.

		# is now created -before- the action operation is executed, and thus before
		# a changeset is automatically started (we do this so we don't have to worry
		# about exceptions). But by the time ->record() is called, we know the operation
		# has succeeded, and we also know that a new changeset has been created if the
		# operation was not already wrapped in a transaction. Se we just set it now:
		$ChangeContext->ChangeSetContext($self) unless ($ChangeContext->ChangeSetContext);
		
		# Extra check for good measure:
		die "Attempted to add changes attached to a different changeset!"
			unless ($self == $ChangeContext->ChangeSetContext);
